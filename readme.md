# Oracle Database SQL Certification Practice

## Motivation
------------------------------------------------------
* Having read several articles over the Internet on how structured query language (SQL) can often be a highly sought-after skill for data analysts and data scientists. I took it upon myself to take a course provide through the Institute of Veterans & Military Families as part of a program called Onward to Opportunity. The course I chose I was the Oracle Database 12 SQL Associate Certification course. Having had some previous knowledge of SQL, I wanted to gain a much deeper understanding in not only writing more complex queries, but a deeper understanding on relational databases. 

## Solidifying skills  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* When it comes to learning a new skill or advancing a current skill, I find that watching videos and doing practice test questions will only go so far when it comes to applying skills in the workplace. My first goal is to pass the exam. Passing the exam is only the beginning. In order to retain the skills, I have learned, I continue to find ways to apply the skills I have learned by writing and executing queries against from a det of data. Although this project involves querying from mock data that I have created, I believe it does serve the purpose in helping to reinforce what I have learned. 
 

## Project format
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* This project will consist of creating a series of separate files. Each file which will be a Jupyter Notebook file and will consists of several SQL queries focusing on key topics. At the same time, I will make notes along the way. Through doing this project, I hope to not only enhance my skills, but to potentially have this project serve as reference for others in having questions on how to write SQL queries that return the desired data. Writing efficient queries to retrieve the data prior to working in a coding environment will help to streamline the process in analyzing the data.
